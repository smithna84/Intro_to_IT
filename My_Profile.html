    <!-- Interest in IT Section -->

        <div class="it" id="interest">
          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>I have an interest in IT as it just makes sense to me. I enjoy playing games, writing code and learning something new. <br>
            My interest began as a kid when we got our first family computer. I was always on it. Mostly playing games at that age. <br>
            It grew from there when I become more interested in what my Dad was doing as he was working as an IT engineer. When I left <br>
            school, I enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so I could follow in my dad's footsteps. I have now been working in <br>
            IT for the last 10 years across 4 different jobs. Have spent the last 9 years on 2 separate support desks. This has given me <br>
            experience in IT and get exposure to different things. My current job has given me more experience in software development, <br>
            which is where I see my career going.
          </p>
          <p>I chose RMIT after discussing my options with an advisor with Open Universities. RMIT had a course that was more tailored to <br>
            becoming a software developer. The subjects also got me excited to choose this course as it was going to give me the necassary <br>
            learning and insights to achieve my goal.
          </p>
          <p>I expect to learn best practices when coding. When to add comments and when not to. How to work effectively in a team. <br>
            I also expect to learn everything that will allow me to get my first job as a software developer.

            <h4>Position Description: </h4>
            <p>A full stack machine learning engineer designs and maintains the infrastructure required while also
              designing and executing the experiments with machine learning models. Will be required to translate
              the business requirements, and design customarchitecture and processing techniques. Required to
              implement best practice procedures and processes.
             </p>
             <p> This role appeals to me as I am interested in AI and machine learning and this is not a role,
               I will be able to do straight after graduating but is something I will have to work towards.

            <p> My plan is to complete the Bachelor of Information technology with Distinction with
              a minor in Economics. I already have plans to learn Python and have seen the differences
              between C# and Python already. I will try to get a job in data analysis as I think this
              would be a good steppingstone in to Machine Learning and will be able to start using
              machine learning to analyse data.

    <!-- Project Idea Section -->

        <div class="idea" id="project">
          <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This project is to develop and building a navigation application linked to
            earbuds with built-in cameras for the visually impaired. The application will
            be able to guide the user to a location with voice directions but also advise
            how to avoid an object as well as assistance with boarding trains and buses.
            The application will also be able map new locations such as houses, apartments
            and public buildings. Application will be voice activated and configured to accept
            only the hosts voice.
          </p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The motivation behind this project is to develop artificial intelligence that will
            benefit the visually impaired. It is estimated that there is over 575,000 people who
            are blind or visually impaired. While there has been massive in roads in technology
            for the blind, I feel there is still a long way to go in bridging the gap of what is
            currently available and what is possible that will allow the blind to navigate this
            world as a non-visually impaired person can. The day where you cannot tell someone
            walking next to you is blind is something we should be striving for.
          </p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This project will develop a mobile application that will link to earbuds that have
            multiple cameras in each earbud. The application will use the phones built-in navigation
            to determine location and guide the user to their destination. With the multiple cameras
            in the earbuds, the application will be able to determine what is an object in front of
            them that the user needs to navigate around but also what is to their left and right as well
            as behind them. If public transport is required, the user will be guided to where the train
            doors or bus door is, and which is an available seat.

            The application will be able to map out the floor plan of houses, apartments and public buildings.
            This will allow for the user to be guided to bathrooms when visiting friends, and other rooms. The
            floor plans will be saved for future use.

            The application will be voice activated and mapped to the users’ voice; this will prevent the application
            from picking up any other voices when in crowded places.

            As the application learns, the user’s regular appointments and destinations will be stored and be able
            to automatically trigger based on the devices date and time and direct the user. Calendar integration
            will allow for automatic navigation for appointments with a location.

          </p>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>Application will be built from scratch.
          </p>
          <h3>Skills Required </h3>
          <p>For this project, proficient skills in programming will be required to create the basis of
            the application. There will also be efficiency in machine learning algorithms required to
            develop means for the application to learn what an object is, how to avoid objects and.
            Experience in engineering design as well as manufacturing the earbuds will also be needed.
          </p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>When completed, further independence will be available to the visually impaired with users
            of the application being able to navigate the world without the assistance of others. The
            concepts of the application and multiple cameras could open the door to expanding the
            application to allowing a visually impaired person to drive. All though this idea would
            make the Guide Dogs associations’ work in training dogs to see for the visually impaired
            redundant, it could open the path for the association to change direction and work with
            them in developing the application further with the hardware only available for sale
            through the Guide Dogs Association.

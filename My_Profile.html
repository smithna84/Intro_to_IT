        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>I have an interest in IT as it just makes sense to me. I enjoy playing games, writing code and learning something new. <br>
         My interest bagan as a kid when we got our first family computer. I was always on it. Mostly playing games at that age. <br>
         It grew from there when I become more interested in what my Dad was doing as he was working as an IT engineer. When I left <br>
         school, I enrolled in Tafe to become a network engineer so I could follow in my dad's footsteps. I have now been working in <br>
         IT for the last 10 years across 4 different jobs. Have spent the last 9 years on 2 separate support desks. This has given me <br>
         experience in IT and get exposure to different things. My current job has given me more experience in software development, <br>
         which is where I see my career going.
        </p>
        <p>I choose RMIT after discussing my options with an advisor with Open Universities. RMIT had a course that was more tailored to <br>
         becoming a software developer. The subjects also got me expired to choose this course as it was going to give me the necassary <br>
         learning and insights to achieve my goal.
        </p>
        <p>I expect to learn best practices when coding. When to add comments and when not to. How to work effectively in a team. <br>
         I also expect to learn everything that will allow me to get my first job as a software developer.
